This is a solution for 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course assignment.
The repository contains the following files:
 - *README.md* - this file
 - *CodeBook.md* - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
 - *run_analysis.R* - a script that performs data transformations described in the code book and creates a tidy dataset file

The script downloads and unpacks a source dataset if necessary. Source the script file to run it. The result file with tidy dataset is `step5data.txt`.
